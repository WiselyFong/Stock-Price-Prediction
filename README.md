# Stock-Price-Prediction

<p align="justify">
This project focuses on building stock price predictions using classification machine learning algorithms such as <b>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</b>, <b>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</b>, <b>Random Forest</b>, and <b>Logistic Regression</b>. These algorithms aim to predict the future value of a single stock, a certain industry, or the market by using our stock price prediction model. The goal is to apply the knowledge gained in our data science course to solve real-world problems by predicting stock price trends and assisting investors in making informed decisions.
